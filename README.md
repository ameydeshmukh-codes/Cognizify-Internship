# Java Development Internship - Cognifyz Technologies

This repository serves as a portfolio of the tasks completed during my Java Development Internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The projects demonstrate proficiency in core Java concepts, including object-oriented programming, file handling, data structures, and algorithm design.

## 📂 Project Structure

### Level 1: Core Java Fundamentals
Focused on basic syntax, loops, and string manipulation.

* **Task 1: Temperature Converter**
    * **Description:** A CLI program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit based on user selection.
    * **Key Skills:** Input/Output operations, Arithmetic logic.
    
* **Task 2: Palindrome Checker**
    * **Description:** An algorithm that verifies if a word or phrase reads the same backward as forward, ignoring punctuation and casing.
    * **Key Skills:** String manipulation, Loops, Conditionals.

* **Task 3: Student Grade Calculator**
    * **Description:** A program that accepts multiple grades, calculates the average, and displays the result.
    * **Key Skills:** Array processing, Iteration, Mathematical logic.

* **Task 4: Random Password Generator**
    * **Description:** Generates secure random passwords with customizable length and character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).
    * **Key Skills:** `java.util.Random`, String building.

### Level 2: Intermediate Application Development
Focused on complex logic, 2D arrays, and File I/O.

* **Task 1: Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
    * **Description:** A robust, two-player console game.
    * **Features:** * Crash-proof input validation (handles non-numeric inputs).
        * Win/Draw detection algorithms.
        * Replayability features (Game loop).
    * **Key Skills:** 2D Arrays, Game Logic, State Management.

* **Task 2: Password Strength Checker**
    * **Description:** Analyzes a user-inputted password against security criteria (length, character variety) to determine its strength.
    * **Key Skills:** String analysis, Conditional Logic.

* **Task 3: File Encryption/Decryption**
    * **Description:** A tool that encrypts or decrypts text files using a substitution algorithm.
    * **Key Skills:** File Handling (`java.io`), Stream processing.
